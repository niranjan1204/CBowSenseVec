# python implementation 
Implemented a non-parametric model which disambiguates between the multiple senses of a polysemic word
Extended the continuous bag of words architecture with context sensitive clustering of word embeddings
Performed alternating optimization of word embedding evaluation and word sense disambiguation
Implemented in Python using NLTK, Gensim and Scikit-Learn libraries for the numerical computations
